### 🔁 Development Approach

This project continues to follow the **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** cycle inspired by the original repository:

1. 🟥 **Red** — Write a failing test that defines the expected behavior.  
2. 🟩 **Green** — Implement just enough code to make the test pass.  
3. 🧹 **Refactor** — Improve the code while keeping all tests green.

Each commit represents progress through these stages, highlighting the disciplined nature of TDD.

### 🎯 Objective

This fork aims to **modify and expand** the original project while maintaining the TDD philosophy.  
Specifically, it seeks to:

- Enhance understanding of **Test-Driven Development principles**
- Introduce new features or improvements
- Preserve clear documentation and testing discipline
